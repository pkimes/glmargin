`glmargin`
---

This package contains implementations of the method described in [this arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5260).
Although the package passes build, it was written for personal recordkeeping and is not intended for widespread use.
Therfore, many functions are not fully optimized, and the corresponding documentation is sparse.
